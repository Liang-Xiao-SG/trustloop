# TrustLoop MVP Development Document

## 1. Project Brief

### 1.1. Objective
TrustLoop is a mobile-first app for requesting and offering **help** within a socially trusted network. Unlike gig platforms, TrustLoop revolves around favors and connections. Every favor can be traced through a relationship path, like *"my mother's friend"* or *"my colleague's cousin"*. Users track who helped whom and how connections evolve.

### 1.2. Target Users
- **Requesters** ‚Äì individuals seeking help
- **Helpers** ‚Äì individuals who offer to fulfill tasks
- **Indirect Connectors** ‚Äì users connected via mutual trusted relationships (multi-hop)

---

## 1.3. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native + Expo + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)  
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (email, optional magic link)  
- **Notifications:** Expo Push Notifications  
- **Graph Utilities:** PostgreSQL recursive CTEs & cached contact path table  
- **UI Libraries:** ShadCN (React Native compatible)
